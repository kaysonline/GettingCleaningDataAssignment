# Code Book for Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project
The dataset in tidy_data_set.csv is generated by running the run_analysis.R to transform the data from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset". A full description is available [here] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) where the data was obtained.

## About the data set
The features selected for this dataset come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ).

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

6. Column bind the three data frames to form one test data frame
5. Load subject_train.txt, X_train.txt & y_train.txt data files and set the column names
6. Column bind the three data frames to form one train data frame
7. Merge test and train data frames together
8. Filter the feature names only to ones that have mean() or std() in their name
9. Filter the merged data frame from step 7 to get only the feature names filtered in step 8
10. A few feature names have double "Body" in the name, tidy the feature names
