# Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project Programming Assignment
The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with and clean a dataset. The outcome of this assignment is to produce a tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article] (http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
